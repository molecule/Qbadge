#Qbadge

##Enjoy your Qbadge!

This little wearable is so much more than it first appears… At this exclusive event you’ll discover just how much you can do with hardware. Especially when it’s combined with the power of a community board like Qualcomm’s 410c Dragonboard. The Internet of Things awaits… 

##Guided tour

Aside from the beautiful LEDs, the Qbadge also has lots of ways to communicate. The front of the Qbadge has an infrared receiver, an intrared transmitter, a button to trigger an action, and a microphone.

On the inside, there’s also a BLE module tucked away beneath the main processor board.
